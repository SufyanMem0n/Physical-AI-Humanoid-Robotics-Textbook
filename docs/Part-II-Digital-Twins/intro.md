# Part II: Digital Twins (Weeks 4-6)

In this module, you will learn how to create and utilize digital twins—virtual replicas of physical robots and their environments. This is a critical skill for modern roboticists, enabling rapid prototyping, testing, and validation before deploying to expensive hardware.

## Chapters in this Part

- **Chapter 4: Robot Modeling with URDF**
- **Chapter 5: Simulation with Gazebo**
- **Chapter 6: Advanced Gazebo**

You will learn to model complex robots, build simulated worlds, and integrate sensors and physics to create high-fidelity simulations.
