# Part I: Foundations (Weeks 1-3)

This first module lays the groundwork for all future topics. We will explore the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and get hands-on with the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the industry-standard software development kit for robotics.

## Chapters in this Part

- **Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI**
- **Chapter 2: ROS 2 for Beginners**
- **Chapter 3: Advanced ROS 2**

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the software architecture used in modern robotics and be able to create your own ROS 2 applications.
