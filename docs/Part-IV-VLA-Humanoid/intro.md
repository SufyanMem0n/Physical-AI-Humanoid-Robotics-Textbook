# Part IV: VLA & Humanoid Robotics (Weeks 10-13)

This final module takes you to the absolute cutting edge of robotics and artificial intelligence. Having mastered simulation, control, and GPU-accelerated training, you are now ready to tackle the grand challenges: creating robots that can understand human language, walk on two legs, and manipulate objects with dexterity. This is the frontier where general-purpose, autonomous robots are born.

Here, all the preceding concepts converge. The digital twins you built are used to train the policies, the ROS 2 architecture integrates the components, and the AI models we explore provide the intelligence. This is the final step in your transformation from a robotics practitioner to a leader in the field of Physical AI.

## Chapters in this Part

### Chapter 10: Vision-Language-Action Models
The dream of robotics has always been to simply tell a robot what to do. This is now becoming a reality with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. In this chapter, you will dive into the architecture of transformative models like Google's RT-2, learning how they fuse natural language commands with real-time visual data to generate robot actions. We'll go beyond theory and work on fine-tuning these models for custom manipulation tasks.

### Chapter 11: Bipedal Locomotion
Walking is one of the most difficult challenges in all of robotics. You will learn the control theory behind dynamic bipedal locomotion, starting with the concepts of Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Center of Mass (COM) for maintaining balance. We will then implement advanced, whole-body Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) that allow a humanoid to adapt its gait to uneven terrain in real-time.

### Chapter 12: Whole-Body Manipulation
Once a humanoid can walk, it must interact. This chapter focuses on the complex problem of **mobile manipulation**—coordinating locomotion and arm movements to perform useful work. You'll explore dual-arm coordination for complex tasks and the critical nuances of safe, physical human-robot interaction, culminating in a project to have the humanoid perform a delicate object handover to a person.

### Chapter 13: Industry Best Practices & Production Deployment
An incredible prototype is not a product. The final chapter makes your skills production-ready. We cover the non-negotiable elements of deploying real-world robotic systems: implementing robust safety systems, building CI/CD pipelines for reliable updates, and performance tuning for latency-critical applications. This chapter consolidates your learning and prepares you to deliver real business value.

Completing this module signifies that you are ready to build the future of robotics.
