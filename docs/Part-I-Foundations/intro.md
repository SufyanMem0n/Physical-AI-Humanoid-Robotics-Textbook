# Part I: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)

Every robust, intelligent system is built upon a solid foundation. This first module is arguably the most critical in your journey, as it establishes the fundamental software engineering principles and practices that govern modern robotics. We will move directly into the heart of robotics development with the **Robot Operating System (ROS 2)**.

While "Operating System" is in the name, ROS 2 is more accurately a powerful framework and set of tools that abstracts the complexity of robotics hardware. It is the de facto industry standard for a reason: it provides the modularity, scalability, and community support necessary to build production-grade systems, not just academic prototypes.

## Chapters in this Part

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
We begin by defining what "Physical AI" truly means in an industry context. This chapter goes beyond the hype to establish the hardware and software requirements for building intelligent robots. You will set up your professional development environment and write your very first ROS 2 node, taking the first concrete step toward building a real-world robotics application.

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Essentials
With the basics covered, we dive into the core architecture of ROS 2. You will gain a deep understanding of the key concepts that make ROS 2 so powerful: **Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions**. We will focus on the publisher/subscriber pattern, the workhorse of ROS 2 systems, and learn how to manage and launch complex, multi-node systems using launch files and packages.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid grasp of the core architecture of modern robotics software and be ready to apply it to a virtual robot in the next section.
